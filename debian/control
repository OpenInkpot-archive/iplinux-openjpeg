Description: development files for libopenjpeg2, a JPEG 2000 image library
 Libopenjpeg2 is a library for handling the JPEG 2000 image compression format.
 JPEG 2000 is a wavelet-based image compression standard and permits progressive
 transmission by pixel and resolution accuracy for progressive downloads of an
 encoded image. It supports lossless and lossy compression, supports higher
 compression than JPEG 1991, and has resilience to errors in the image.

Description: debug symbols for libopenjpeg2, a JPEG 2000 image library
 This package contains the debug symbols to match the runtime component of the
 libopenjpeg2 library, allowing debugging of a program using libopenjpeg2 to
 access debugging details within the library itself.

Package: openjpeg-tools

Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: command-line tools using the JPEG 2000 library
 This package provides with command-line tools allowing for conversions between
 several formats:
  - j2k_to_image: decodes j2k, jp2, and jpt files to pgm, ppm, pnm,
                  pgx, and bmp.
  - image_to_j2k: encodes pnm, pgm, pgx, bmp, and ppm files to j2k,
                  and jp2.
  - index_create: create jp2 with JPIP index file from a j2k file.
